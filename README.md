# wind-scraper

#When I first moved to SF I once commented to my brother that it seemed like the wind slowed down at night and it was more peaceful. He was baffled by my comment and strongly disagreed. I built this program to practice building a webscraper/generate data/clean it etc., but also to try prove him wrong.
